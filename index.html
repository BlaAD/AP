The Audio of “Live Your Life” was officially distributed all over during the month of January 2017, with the intension of message being, “this new year, you’ve got to life your life”. It was then followed by the video release on the same week.

				<h4 style=color:black;>More information about | UTHNECHA NEPAL</h4></style>
				<p>On 25 th of April, a devastating earthquake of magnitude 7.8 hit Nepal. There were

helping hands headed towards Nepal from all over the world. The earthquake had

affected millions of Nepalese and caused thousands of deaths. Everyone was helping

any way they could, and this song was Chosang &amp; Arpan Pokharel’s approach. This

song was immediately composed, recorded and produced within a matter of days

after the earthquake hit. The purpose of this song was to generate money, 1 euro for

every download, which would be donated for earthquake relief.
</p>
<p>

Uthnecha Nepal was already distributed in all digital stores by the end of April. The

documentary type music video, consisting of footages collected from earthquake-

affected areas, was released on the first week of May 2015. The video quickly gained

traction and many people got emotional after watching the devastating impact of

the earthquake. Chosang’s vocals and Arpan Pokharel’s composition/lyrics triggered

many emotions, one being the strength to recover and stand behind Nepal more

than ever.
</p>

														<p>	You Make Me Smile is one of the happiest love songs out there. It triggers your heartstrings and you cannot help but sing along. It reflects all the happy emotions triggered while in love and the thoughts sparked by the person you love.

You Make Me Smile was actually composed and produced early 2015. However, due to the unfortunate event of the earthquake hitting Nepal, Arpan Pokharel decided to put a hold on this song, as it wouldn’t have been a decent time to release love songs. Instead, many campaigns to help Nepal were initiated. The audio for You Make Me Smile was distributed during the end of August 2015. The official music video shot in beautiful locations of Switzerland and Germany was released on February 2016. However, many other unofficial lyrical and lip-sync videos were released prior to that.

														<p>
															Falling in love is a beautiful thing. The feeling of being loved is enough to make someone smile like an idiot while staring at nothing but empty space. Missing a person that you love is a beautiful thing too, but not being physically nearby and all that distance can be very painful at times. Maya Ko Sansar expresses just that. It shows a world of love where physical distance exists between two loved ones but doesn’t exists in heart. It expresses one’s thoughts and imagination, which occurs while you miss the one you love.

Maya Ko Sansar was composed and produced in the year 2014. The audio of the song was officially distributed to all major digital stores in November 2014. Midas Thapa has smartly penned the Lyrics of the song, expressing a lot of feelings using few words. The songs composition and vocals got very popular very quickly and it has been many people’s favorite since. The official music video for Maya Ko Sansar was released by Vevo during the month of November 2014.

														<h4 style="color:black;">More information about the song</h4>
<p>With all the love songs making rounds, there had to be a break to the pattern. With every next song being a love song, “The Hate Song” came in as a surprise. Instead of singing about how much a boy loves a girl, or what can he do for her, this song takes the rather unorthodox approach of singing about why a boy resents a girl. Giving it a thought, it is actually very relatable and realistic. The path of love is not all sunshine and roses. Thus, The Hate Song.

The Hate Song was composed and produced in the year 2013. However, audio of the song was not released until late 2014. Music director Arpan Pokharel wrote the lyrics himself and Chosang’s strong vocal clearly conveys the required feeling of frustration towards the listener. The lyrical video was officially released during the month of October 2014.

<p>Song Chahincha Malai reflects on ones requirements for emotional satisfaction. A person’s love can be very selfish, especially when it’s a one-sided thing. It creates an emotional void, which can only be filled by your loved one. It is to fill that void that we need those little emotionally fulfilling moments more than ever, such as warmth of being loved, sense of the heartbeat or just a smile. Chahincha Malai expresses those needs.

The audio of Chahincha Malai was officially distributed in the beginning of February 2015. Music video was released a month later, on March 2015. Chosang’s vocal perfectly expresses the desperation of one-sided love and the needs to fill the emptiness. The composer, Arpan Pokharel, has penned the lyrics and music himself.

<h3> Chosang &amp; Arpan Pokharel </h3>

Chosang &amp; Arpan Pokharel was the beginning of a new musical journey. Chosang is a

vocalist based in Amsterdam who is originally from Tibet. The duo crossed paths

one fine day and discovered that they share a mutual vision regarding music. It

wasn’t long before the duo’s first single was released under the name “Chosang &amp;

Arpan Pokharel”. They have went on to release many more projects ever since and

there are many more to come.
